# Stage 5 Monetization Test

Last updated: 2026-07-05

## Goal

Test whether RaidBench visitors have purchase intent before building user accounts, credits, or a
custom checkout backend.

## Offer

```text
Rust Raid Prep Pack
Price: USD 9
Format: downloadable checklist and worksheet pack
Delivery: manual first, automated later
```

## Why This Offer

- It is small enough for an impulse purchase.
- It matches the calculator use case.
- It does not require a credits ledger.
- It can be delivered manually at first.
- It can validate paid intent before a full product build.

## Current Implementation

Public offer page:

```text
https://supermszhanghao-eng.github.io/raidbench/premium.html
```

Current mode:

```text
Early access / purchase intent only. Real checkout is disabled until PayPal is configured.
```

Files:

- `premium.html` - offer page.
- `premium.js` - checkout/interest behavior and events.
- `config.js` - PayPal payment link configuration.
- `operations/delivery-log-template.csv` - manual fulfillment record template.
- `operations/raid-prep-pack-outline.md` - first product outline.

## PayPal Setup

Fastest route:

1. Create or confirm a PayPal Business account.
2. Create a PayPal Payment Link or Buy Button for `Rust Raid Prep Pack`.
3. Price it at `9.00 USD`.
4. Set a clear product description and delivery expectation.
5. Paste the hosted PayPal URL into `config.js`:

```js
window.RAIDBENCH_CONFIG = {
  ga4MeasurementId: "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
  analyticsDebug: false,
  premiumOffer: {
    offerId: "raid-prep-pack-9",
    paypalPaymentLink: "https://www.paypal.com/...",
    contactEmail: "support@example.com",
  },
};
```

Do not enable payment until delivery records are ready.

## Delivery Records

For digital goods, keep a basic order log:

| Field | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| PayPal transaction ID | Payment lookup and dispute handling |
| Buyer email | Delivery evidence |
| Product name | Confirms what was purchased |
| Sent timestamp | Proof of fulfillment |
| Delivery method | Email, file link, or account access |
| Access/download timestamp | Useful if available |
| Refund/dispute status | Follow-up tracking |

## Events

The premium flow records these events through `analytics.js`:

- `premium_offer_view`
- `premium_interest_click`
- `premium_interest_submit`
- `premium_checkout_click`

Recommended GA4 custom dimensions:

- `offer_id`
- `price_usd`
- `checkout_provider`
- `email_domain`
- `player_type`

## Decision Rules

Continue to real checkout if:

- At least 3-5 non-test visitors click the premium CTA, or
- At least 1 real visitor submits interest, or
- Search Console shows repeated traffic to raid planning pages.

Do not build credits yet if:

- No one clicks the premium CTA.
- Users use only one-off calculators.
- There is no repeat intent signal.

Move toward credits later if:

- Users ask for custom plans.
- Users repeatedly create or share raid plans.
- A paid pack gets purchases or serious interest.
